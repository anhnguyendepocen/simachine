Description: A basic simulation framework that allows writing simulation code in
    little isolated snippets and disallows silly things like overwriting immutable
    state. Meant to be correct and hopefully fast.  The package only
    uses basic R features and sets up simulation in environments
    isolated from .GlobalEnv.
